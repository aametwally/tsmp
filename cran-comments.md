## Known Issues (a.k.a NOTES)

* Installed size is 5.6Mb. 
  * This is due to datasets in this package. I believe they are essential to learning all the features
    of this package.

* Uses the superseded package: `doSNOW`
  * `doSNOW` has a property that allows to use progress bar that `parallel` does not.
  * Working in finding a better solution to drop this dependency. Not found yet.
  
* (possibly) invalid URLs: https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/FastestSimilaritySearch.html
  * Debian: libcurl throws an error on certificate check. Nothing to do about this.

* Authors@R field gives persons with non-standard roles
